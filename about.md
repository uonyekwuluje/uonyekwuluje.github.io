Hi, My name is Uchechukwu Onyekwuluje. I love Coding/Scripting, Systems Administration/Engineering/Operation, DevOps, Site Reliability, and All things Clouds.

This site is about most things Tech, DevOps, Clouds, Security, Coding, Scripting etc. My cheetsheat of facts, solutions and knowledge gained over the years. 
I have found that sometimes the solutions to the difficult problems are the little things. Keeping things simple, easy to use and easy to find is what the site 
is all about.
