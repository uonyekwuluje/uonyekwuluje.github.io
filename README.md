Hi, My name is Uchechukwu Onyekwuluje. I am a Software Development Engineer at Nuance.

I love computer systems and I have a preference for the full stack approach to problem solving. Computer systems don't work in isolation
of each other and that forms the basis of my approach.

I work with Azure, GCP, AWS, Linux, Python, Automation Tools, Configuration Management Tools, Containers, Infrastructure, Open Source, 
Knowledge Sharing, Metrics etc.
I have well over 10 years of experience in the IT Industry ranging from Systems Administration, Systems Engineering, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering and Software Engineering.

This site is about my cheetsheet of facts, solutions and knowledge gained over the years. I have found that sometimes the solutions to the 
difficult problems are the little things. Keeping things simple, easy to use and easy to find is what the site is all about.
