Hi, My name is Uchechukwu Onyekwuluje. I am a Software Engineer with over 10 years experience in the IT Industry. I have worked in various capacities ranging from Systems Administration, Systems Engineering, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering and Software Engineering. 

I love building tools to automate on-prem and cloud infrastructure in AWS, GCP, Azure. Researching open source tools and using my findings to solve complex problems or improve existing system is something I love to do. 

Some of my specialties and areas of interest are:

- **Programming Languages:** Python, BASH<br>
    *note: My focus is primarily on the backend. That said, languages are simply tools for getting the job done so I tend to pick the best tool or
    what I feel is best for the job. This includes but not limited to Java, Ruby, NodeJS, GO, HTML, CSS etc*
- **Web Frameworks:** Flask, PHP
- **Databases:** Postgres, MariaDB, MongoDB
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Salt, Chef, Puppet
- **IaaS Tools:** Terraform, Packer, Vault, Cloudformation
- **Continuous Integration/Delivery/Deployment:** Jenkins, Gitlab-CI, Azure DevOps
- **Container Services:** Docker, Kubernetes 
- **Virtualization Platforms:** VMware, KVM, XEN, VirtualBox
- **Cloud Services:** AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Monitoring:** Icinga, Prometheus, Sensu  
- **Search & Data:** Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat, Metricbeat, Fluentd, Statsd 

This site is about my findings, solutions and knowledge gained over the years. I have found that sometimes the solutions to the 
difficult problems are the little things. Keeping things simple, easy to use and easy to find is what the site is all about.
