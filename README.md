Hi, My name is Uchechukwu Onyekwuluje. I love Software Development, Toolsmith, DevOps, Site Reliability and All things Clouds.

This site is about DevOps, Clouds, Security, Coding, Scripting etc. My cheetsheat of facts, solutions and knowledge gained over the years. 
I have found that sometimes the solutions to the difficult problems are the little things. Keeping things simple, easy to use and easy to find is what the site is all about.
