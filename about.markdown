   Hi, My name is Uchechukwu Onyekwuluje. I am a Site Reliability Engineer. I have worked in various capacities ranging from Systems Administration, Systems Engineering, DevOps, and Software Engineering. I love building tools to automate on-prem and cloud infrastructure in AWS, GCP, Azure. Researching open source tools and using my findings to solve complex problems or improve existing system is something I love to do. 
   </p>

   <p class="aboutmeparagraphsetting">
   This site is about my findings, solutions and knowledge gained over the years. Solutions to the difficult problems are sometimes the little things. Keeping things simple and handy is what the site is all about.
