`Rsync` (Remote Sync) is the command for copying and synchronizing files and directories remotely as well as locally in Linux/Unix systems.
In this article, we shall examine how rsync can help us sync files or directory content.

## Command Usage and Examples
The general format is `rsync options source destination`

#### Notes
* For folders, including the `/` rsyncs all contents of the folder to the target. Without the `/` it creates and syncs the folder itself and it's contents


#### Rsync Local to Local Files/Directories
rsync all files with extenstion `*.txt` to `/tmp/documents/`
```
rsync -zavh --progress files/*.txt /tmp/documents/
``` 

rsync and update contents in `files/` to `/tmp/documents/`
```
rsync -uzavh --progress files/ /tmp/documents/
```

rsync and update contents in `files/` to `/tmp/documents/`.  Exclude files larger than 500m
```
rsync -uzavh --progress --max-size=500m files/ /tmp/documents/
```

rsync and update contents in `files/` to `/tmp/documents/`.  Exclude files smaller than 1m
```
rsync -uzavh --progress --max-size=1m files/ /tmp/documents/
```

Delete files in `/tmp/documents/` if source no longer exist in `~/files`
```
rsync --progress --recursive --ignore-existing --delete files/ /tmp/documents/
```

Rsync and exclude based on list. File name `exclude-file.txt`
```
files/dir3
files/dir4
files/samplefile.txt
```
Then 
```
rsync -a --progress --exclude-from='exclude-file.txt' files /tmp/documents/
```


#### Rsync Local Files/Directories to Remote
Same actions above to remote host
```
rsync -uzavhe --progress files/ user@192.168.0.11:/tmp/documents/
```


#### Rsync Remote Files/Directories to Local system
Same actions above to remote host
```
rsync -uzavh --progress user@192.168.0.11:/tmp/documents/ ./files/
```
