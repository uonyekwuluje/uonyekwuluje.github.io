Before you start developing code in Java, you need to setup your development environment with the necessary development tools
required to build, compile, test and execute your java code.

# Base Requirements
* **Operating System**: This is the core and starting block. If you are reading this post, you already have one. May be Windows,
  Linux or Mac OS
* **Java Development Kit(JDK)**: This is the foundation and building block of other tools required to write your java code and
  also it's ecosystem. You can download your JDK [Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* **Build/project management tools**: While not compulsory, this will make your life so much easier and stress free.
  * **Maven**: Maven helps and simplifies the build process. You can download Maven [Here](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
  * **Gradle**: Gradle is another tool available for the build process. You can download Maven [Here](https://gradle.org/).
  Personally, I prefer Maven. It's XML based and works great. Just my personal preference.
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: A IDE helps with code entry and also glues your other tools under the hood. A lot
  of them come with debuggers also. You have lots of options here. IntelliJ Idea from Jetbrains, Eclipse, NetBeans etc. Try them
  out and stick with one you are comfortable with.
