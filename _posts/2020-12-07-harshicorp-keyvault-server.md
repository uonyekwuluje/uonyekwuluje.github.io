Managing secrets, tokens, credentials, sensitive data etc., is one of the hallmarks of IT operations. They are lots of tools out there but we will focus on HashiCorp Vault. [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a secrets management tool that helps to provide secure, automated access to sensitive data. In this post, we will install, configure, and access Vault in a DEV envronment to illustrate Vaultâ€™s features and API. We will use the latest version of Vault, which is 1.6.0 at the time of this writing.
