NFS **Network File System** is a distributed file system protocol that allows you to mount remote directories on your desktop, machine. 
In this post, Iâ€™ll go over how to install the software needed for NFS functionality on Debian. While this focuses on Debian, the process
applies to Ubuntu, Centos and others.

#### **Server Installation & Config**
On the NFS server, install this.
```
sudo apt -y install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server
sudo systemctl start nfs-server
```
Create the directory to share on the NFS server.
```
sudo mkdir /opt/data
```
Update the exports file `/etc/exports`
```
/opt/data  *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
```
*NOTE:* In this case, I am allowing all because it's my private network. You have to be more restrictive on other networks<br>
Mount when done
```
sudo exportfs -ar
```



#### **Client Installation & Config**
To configure a client, install the client tools.
```
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
```
Create a directory to mount the remote share. `NFS Server IP => 192.168.1.10`. Client mount point `/opt/data_mount`
I like mounting in `/etc/fstab`.
```
192.168.1.10:/opt/data /opt/data_mount  nfs      defaults    0       0
```
Type this command. `sudo mount -a`. If you type this command `ls /opt/data_mount` you should see the remote content




#### **NFS Options**
NFS mount options

| NFS Options      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| rw          | Allow both read and write requests on a NFS volume.       |
| ro          | Allow only read requests on a NFS volume.        |
| sync        | Reply to requests only after the changes have been committed to stable storage. (Default) |
| async       |	Allows NFS server to reply to requests before any changes made by that request have been committed | 
| secure      |	This option requires that requests originate on an Internet port less than IPPORT_RESERVED (1024). (Default) |
| insecure    |	This option accepts all ports. |
| wdelay      |	Delay committing write request to disc slightly if it suspects that another related write request may be in progress |
| no_wdelay     |  |
| subtree_check    | This option enables subtree checking. (Default) |
| no_subtree_check | This option disables subtree checking |
| root_squash      | Map requests from uid/gid 0 to the anonymous uid/gid. |
| no_root_squash   | Turn off root squashing. |
| all_squash 	   | Map all uids and gids to the anonymous user. Useful for NFS exported public FTP directories |
| no_all_squash    | Turn off all squashing. (Default) |
