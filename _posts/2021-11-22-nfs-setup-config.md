NFS **Network File System** is a distributed file system protocol that allows you to mount remote directories on your desktop, machine. 
In this post, Iâ€™ll go over how to install the software needed for NFS functionality on Debian. While this focuses on Debian, the process
applies to Ubuntu, Centos and others.

#### **Server Installation & Config**
On the NFS server, install this.
```
sudo apt -y install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common
```
Create the directory to share on the NFS server.
```
sudo mkdir /opt/data
```
Update the exports file `/etc/exports`
```
/opt/data  *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```
*NOTE:* In this case, I am allowing all because it's my private network. You have to be more restrictive on other networks<br>
Mount when done
```
sudo exportfs -a
```



#### **Client Installation & Config**
To configure a client, install the client tools.
```
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
```
Create a directory to mount the remote share. `NFS Server IP => 192.168.1.10`. Client mount point `/opt/data_mount`
I like mounting in `/etc/fstab`.
```
192.168.1.10:/opt/data /opt/data_mount  nfs      defaults    0       0
```
Type this command. `sudo mount -a`. If you type this command `ls /opt/data_mount` you should see the remote content
